                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    From a young age, I have had a curiosity about how things
                    worked. This naturally led me to become absolutely obsessed
                    with Lego and I fell in love with building things. In
                    elementary school, I joined the Lego Robotics team at my
                    local middle school, which was my first real exposure to
                    programming.

                    I started programming more seriously 2 years ago,
                    initially learning how to scrape and interact with websites.
                    I went on to do a ton of passion projects, including chat bots,
                    multiple game projects, apps, and more. One of these
                    projects is viewable on my{' '}

                    In 2022, I got accepted into Riverland Community College to study Computer Tech. It was my first choice
                    and I was absolutely ecstatic to be going to such a great
                    university. At the end of my sophomore year, I got to work in some projects, primarily focusing
                    on frontend work. I continued to work on my project during these years.

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I
                            enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible
                            hobbies I have are play with my dogs and spend time with family. I also enjoy playing video games, driving, and reading.

                        <p>
                            In college, I was an active member in the Student Senate
                            and held the position of vice-president in
                            the group. I met a lot of amazing people through
                            my years and thoroughly enjoyed the community.
